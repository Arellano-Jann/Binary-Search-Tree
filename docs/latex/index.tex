Randomly generate 100 unique values in the range of \mbox{[}1-\/200\mbox{]} and insert them into a binary search tree (B\+ST). Print height and inorder, preorder, and postoder output of the B\+ST tree. Deliver source code and a test file that shows the result of printing height and inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Submission details}\label{index_autotoc_md4}

Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following\+: Plagiarism\+: defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work of another as one\textquotesingle{}s own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one\textquotesingle{}s work to be used in this fashion. Cheating\+: defined as (1) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; (2) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; (3) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one\textquotesingle{}s place; (4) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official. Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic dishonesty according to the code of this university.
